# Project Name: Linkedin Authuntication

## Project overview:
* Linkedin provides the developers with an authuntication method tat would let the user login using his linkedin account to your website.

## How can we use it:
1. Step 1: Get Client ID and Client Secret
   - you must create an application using your linkenin account to be able to get your Client ID and Client Secret.
2. Step 2: Generate an Access Token
   - To generate an access token, issue a HTTP POST against accessToken with both your Client ID and Client Secret values.
3. Step 3: Make API Requests
   - Once you've received an access token, you can make API requests by including an Authorization header with your token in the HTTP call to LinkedIn's API.

## This application was created by a team of four:
   - Abdallah Obaid
   - Anas Zain
   - Amer Majdi Yousef
